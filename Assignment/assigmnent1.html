       <h2>Edith Opara and her love for technology</h2>
       <p class="tech">My Passion for Technology started since my childhood. I still remember the time when i waited briefly for an hour to use the school computer.it was then when i saw the school printer printing out a sheet with my name on it. At that age i was <strong>Awed.</strong> How did the computer know my name? How did it learn English? Questions like this have been developed in me since very early on and i have even gotten into trouble by trying to address some of my curiosities. I accidentally deleted the <em>My Computer</em> icon from a school desktop and no one at that time could figure out how to fix it. Nowadays, I follow the advancement in technology through online sources like <strong>Medium</strong> and <strong>Quora</strong> and all the tech news sites</p>
       <p class="tech">As I continued my education, I was not given many opportunities to develope my skills in technology but all the chances I got I valued them and took full advantage of the opportunities offered.Due to this lack of support through the public education system I was forced to learn and continue developing my passion on my own free time. I will continue to grow on my passion for technology. i hope to someday have the materials to experinment and express myself in a creative technologic environment  </p>
